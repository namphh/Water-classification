# Water-classification
# Description about dataset
A water safety data set is a set of data that contains information about the water quality of different sampling points. This data set typically includes parameters such as pH, alkalinity, hardness, total dissolved solids, nitrate content, coliform content, etc.

Water safety data sets are used to assess water quality. If the data set shows that the water quality parameters are within the permissible limits, then the water is considered safe. On the other hand, if the water quality parameters exceed the permissible limits, then the water may not be safe and needs to be treated before use.

# Description about model

The problem uses the SVM model to classify which water is safe and not based on the ingredients in the water
